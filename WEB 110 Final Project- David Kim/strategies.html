        <h2>Understanding the Odds</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Monte Carlo method</b> is used to calculate the odds in Blackjack.
                <ul>
                    <li>The Monte Carlo method is a statistical analysis method which is based on repeated, computational simulations to arrive at normalized likelihoods of events.</li>
                    <li>The probabilities in Blackjack will be different depending on the number of decks used and the number of players.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>    
            <li>In general, the probability of you winning a round of Blackjack is 42.22%. </li>
            <li>In general, the probability of dealer winning a round of Blackjack is 49.1%.</li>
            <li>In general, the probability of a push or tie is the remaining 8.48%.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h2>Basic Strategy Charts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use the basic strategy guides in Blackjack, which have been created by mathematicians using the Monte Carlo method.
                <ul>
                    <li>However, it should be noted that, even with a perfect basic strategy, you only gain about 1% advantage with the house still having around 0.5% edge.</li>
                    <li>This means that, for every $100 you wager, you expect to lose 50 cents.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Therefore, players should aim to <q>win extra</q> on certain hands (blackjacks, double-downs, splits). </li>

        <ul>
            <li>As can be seen above, different rules of the game result in variations in strategies.</li>
            <li>If you want to just memorize one of them as a base reference, I'd recommend using the one where the dealer stands on soft 17 (S17).
                <ul>
                    <li>This is because the cost in errors from employing the wrong strategy happens to be less in soft 17 (S17).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simplified S17 Strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Here is a simplified version of the basic strategy guide under the S17 rule.</li>
