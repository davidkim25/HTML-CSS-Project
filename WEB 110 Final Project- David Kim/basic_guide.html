        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <h3>Setting up</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blackjack is played in rounds and players bet before the beginning of each round.</li>
            <li>At the start of every round, each player receives one card facing up.
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically, dealer distributes cards from own left to right.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once every player has one card facing up, the dealer places own card near the center facing up.</li>
            <li>Next, the dealer distributes to players their second cards, also facing up.
                <ul>
                    <li>These 2 cards are called the player's <b>original hand</b>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After players have their original hands, the dealer places own second card facing down, hiding the value from the players.
                <ul>
                    <li>It is common to have the second card underneath the dealer's first card.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The order of having player's hand being completed before the dealer's will be important in settling bets.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Now, the players will have a brief moment to assess their original hand.
                <ul>
                    <li>If the original hand adds to the value of 21, then this is called Blackjack or "natural".</li>
                    <li><b>Blackjack</b> is a term reserved only for the original hand (2-card hand) and it even trumps a playing hand that may result in 21 with 3 or more cards.</li>
                    <li><u>Hitting a blackjack immediately ends the round for the player</u>, who has to now wait for the dealer's play and bet settlement.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Most likely, players won't have blackjack in their original hand.</li>
            <li><u>From here, players look to create a playing hand that amounts to 21 or higher than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.</u>
            </li>
            <li>Playing hand can be broadly categorized as hard hand vs. soft hand.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hard hand</b> is a playing hand with only distinct values, meaning no Aces in the hand. As long as the hand is without Aces, it is a hard hand.</li>
                    <li><b>Soft hand</b> is a playing hand that involves Aces. Because Ace can be either 11 or 1 in value, its presence introduces flexibility to the gameplay.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Player Decisions</h3>    
        <ul>
            <li>From their original hand, players have several playing decisions available to construct their playing hand.</li>
            <li><b>Hit</b>: Player can ask for another card onto the current playing hand. For visual audit at casinos, players either tap or scratch the table.</li>
            <li><b>Stand</b>: Player can decide to keep the current hand. For visual audit at casinos, players wave a hand over their cards.</li>
            <li><b>Double-down</b>: Player can double the current bet amount and ask for only one additional card to onto the original playing hand. 
                <ul>
                    <li><u>This move is only allowed with the original hand</u>, meaning it won't be an option when the player have 3 or more cards in their playing hand.</li>
                    <li>Logically therefore, doubling down would be performed if the player is feeling certain that the value of 21 can be reached with just one more card onto the original hand. </li>
                    <li><u>The last card added is placed sideways</u> to indicate the playing hand is closed and that no more playing decisions can be made for the round.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Split</b>: If the playing hand consists of a pair of same values, player can choose to split the current value into two equal halves.
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically, the playing hand can be split up to 4 times and if the house rule allows, split cards can be doubled down.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Surrender</b>: Player can choose to forfeit the right to play for the round by surrendering half of the current bet to the dealer. 
                <ul>
                    <li><u>This move is only allowed with the original hand.</u></li>
                    <li>Player keeps the other half of the bet, which can end up being a benefitting play for the player under certain situations.</li>
                    <li>Surrendering is not recognized as a rule in most casinos because it doesn't necessarily favor the house.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><u>Players can make decisions as long as their playing hand doesn't exceed the value of 21.</u></li>
            <li><u>Players must stand on 21 and conclude their play for the round.</u></li>
            <li>If players exceed 21, it is called a <b>bust</b> and players will lose their bets in the settling phase.</li>
            <li><u>If player gets a bust, then the player loses the bet without exception.</u> 
                <ul>
                    <li>This is because the game makes the players go ahead of the dealer. So even though the dealer can bust as well, the player with a bust loses first, counted as a player's loss by design. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dealer's Turn</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Once after all the players have their finalized playing hand, the dealer's hand is revealed and played out.</li>
            <li><u>Dealer doesn't have options to double, split or surrender.</u></li>
            <li>Dealer's hand is played out based around two values - 21 and 17. 
                <ul>
                    <li>21 should be self-explanatory by now, as it is the magic number that determines winning or busting.</li>
                    <li>17 is a benchmark that allows a hand to be called "<b>made hand</b>", which is from 17 to 21 in value.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b><u>Dealer's hand is resolved by drawing until the hand achieves a total of 17 or higher.</u></b>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Now, the rule for resolving dealer's hand at 17 is crucial to Blackjack's gameplay.</u></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Originally, Blackjack was developed with a rule that required dealers to stand on all 17s, both in hard and soft 17s. This is commonly abbreviated as <b>S17 (Stand on 17)</b>. 
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, dealer's original hand of Ace and 6 had to stand. Also, dealer's playing hand of 7,8,2 had to stand.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Later, casinos started implementing a rule that allowed dealers to hit on soft 17s, abbreviated as <b>H17 (Hit on 17)</b>. This rule opened possibilities to the house of obtaining higher made cards against the players. 
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, the dealer's original hand of 6 and Ace will now be hit for a chance to obtain the result of 18,19,20 and 21. Similarly, dealer's playing hand of 7,7,2,A will be hit under the same rule.</li>
                    <li>Statistically, this rule favors the house by 0.2%.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Settling bets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If player hit a blackjack and the dealer didn't get a blackjack, the payout is made with a ratio of 3 to 2.
                <ul>
                    <li>This means player will receive 1.5x the bet amount while also retaining the bet amount.</li>
                    <li>For example, if blackjack was obtained with a $10 bet, then the player receives $15 dollars from the dealer as a winning on top of reclaming the $10 bet.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If players bust, they lose their bet amount.</li>
            <li>If the dealer busts, players with surviving hands will be paid equal to the bet amount.</li>
            <li>If the dealer does not bust, players with higher hand will be paid equal to the bet amount.</li>
            <li>If hands are tied, then it is called "push" or "stand-off" and bets are returned without adjustment.</li>
            <li>After settlements, the played cards are collected in a separate tray. As the original deck of cards starts to run low, the played cards are shuffled back into the deck.</li>
        </ul>
